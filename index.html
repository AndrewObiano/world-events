                    <div id="bread">
                    Otto Frederick Rohwedder of Davenport, Iowa, invented the first single loaf bread-slicing machine. The first commercial use of the machine was by the Chillicothe Baking Company of Chillicothe, Missouri, which sold their first slices on July 7, 1928. The bread was advertised as "the greatest forward step in the baking industry since bread was wrapped."</div>

Millions of investors’ dollars were lost, banks had collapsed, and 15 million Americans were unemployed. This created a ripple effect across the globe with almost every country seeing largescale unemployment and deflation.</div>

                                            During the time of the Middle Ages and the Black Death, education and knowledge were relatively stagnant. But starting in the 15th century, there was a rebirth of knowledge, art, and culture that started in Italy and spread across Europe. This rebirth brought with it new technologies and advancements, which created more prosperity and wealth.

                                                One of the greatest inventions of the Renaissance was The Gutenberg Printing Press. Gutenberg took the idea of printing from Asia but made it much easier and more efficient with his press. The first books he printed were Bibles, and they were all sold before he even finished them. The printing press fanned the flames of reading and education.

                                                    The Boxer Rebellion, Boxer Uprising or Yihetuan Movement was an anti-imperialist uprising which took place in China towards the end of the Qing dynasty between 1899 and 1901. It was initiated by the Militia United in Righteousness, known in English as the "Boxers," and was motivated by proto-nationalist sentiments and opposition to foreign imperialism and associated Christian missionary activity.

                                                        The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in Europe and the US, in the period from about 1760 to about 1840. This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, the increasing use of steam power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the factory system.
